MuseApp is a digital platform that connects artists and customers.

Artists such as dancers, singers, painters, musicians, and performers can create profiles on MuseApp.
Artists can upload portfolios, define pricing, availability, and working radius.

Customers can explore artist profiles, view portfolios, read reviews, and book artists.

MuseApp works like a professional network for artists where bookings are managed digitally.

Bookings depend on artist availability and working radius.

Payments are handled securely through MuseApp.

Cancellations depend on the artist's cancellation policy.
